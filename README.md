## Project Overview

Comprehensive data project covering cleaning, SQL analysis, visualization, and prediction using the Bike Buyers dataset.

## Main Question
Who is target audience for selling bikes?

---

##  Data Sources

The primary dataset was sourced from Kaggle:
* **Bike Buyers 1000:** [Download here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/bike-buyers?select=bike_buyers.csv)

---

##  Tools

The following tools and technologies were used for this analysis:

* **SQL** - Data Cleaning and Analysis (specifically for data manipulation and preparation).
* **Power BI** - Data Visualisation.
* **Python, Matplotlib** - Data Visualisation.

---

##  Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following key tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involved exploring the suicide data to answer key questions, such as:
* Which factors impact suicide rate most?
* Which time periods had the highest rates and why?
* What is the biggest factor contributing to the rates?

---

##  Data Analysis

The core data processing was performed using SQL.
